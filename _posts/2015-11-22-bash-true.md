I see that many people use in bash the common pattern

{% highlight console %}
BUILD=1

if [ "$BUILD" -ne 0 ]
then
	make
fi
{% endhighlight %}

I have been using for years a more compact approach:

{% highlight console %}
BUILD=true

if $BUILD
then
	make
fi
{% endhighlight %}

If we do not want to preinitialize the variables:

{% highlight console %}
BUILD=true

if ${BUILD:-false}   ## Or true, whatever the default is
then
	make
fi
{% endhighlight %}

Of course with this mechanism we are trusting the variable contents, which is usually the case in an inmense majority of cases.
